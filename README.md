## Rules of the game - Proposals / Ideas

* Size (both visual, as well as 'physical' (collision)) depends on the amount of resources an entity currently possesses
* Movement costs are a percentage of the resources possessed (moving is more expensive for bigger entities)
* Resource production are a percentage of the resources possessed (bigger entities produce resources faster)
* Entities can only divide, when they reached a fixed size
* Entities can only divide into two new entities, each being half the size of the former entity
* In a fight both fighting entities loose the same amount of resources.
* If an entity runs out of resources, it dies.
* Costs (for Upgrades) should be auto-balancing
  * e.g. by following economic rules
    * the more an upgrade is purchased by anyone/the player, the more expensive it will get

## Skills
